In my [GSoC23 project](https://davidbtadokoro.github.io/posts/got-accepted-into-gsoc-2023), I
had to understand the ins and outs of the lore API. By its API, I specifically
mean the way requests to <https://lore.kernel.org> are responded, in other words,
the syntax and semantics of requesting data stored in the lore archives, be it
patches or available lists. 

From the outset, the most critical point in my project was if the lore API provided
the necessary for [`kw patch-hub`](https://kworkflow.org/man/features/patch-hub.html),
like I mentioned in my [final report]({% post_url 2023-08-26-gsoc23-final-report %}).

In this post, I'll talk about what I discovered about the lore API and how we used it
in the development of `kw patch-hub` during my GSoC23 project.

## **Linux kernel Contribution Model**

---

When contributing to an Open-Source project, the contributor must first have a
personal copy of the official project's code. This "official project's code" can
be a git repository and this "personal copy" can be a fork of the former, for example.
The second step is to find and make the desired change in the personal copy of
the project's code. Lastly, for the change to be incorporated into the project, in
other words, to make it official, the change must be sent to the project's maintainers
for review.

Many projects fit this simplistic description of a contribution model. For instance,
kw satisfies this model if we consider the official project's code to be the
[official kw GitHub repository](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow), my personal
copy to be my [GitHub fork of kw repository](https://github.com/davidbtadokoro/kworkflow)
and the way of sending changes from my fork to the official repository to be
[Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

The Linux kernel contribution model is similar to this, with the major difference
of changes (named *patches*) being sent through public mailing lists. In general,
Git is used for Source Code Management (SCM) in most Linux subsystems, but, unlike
kw, changes aren't sent upstream through Pull Requests, but rather as an email sent
to a public mailing list (or lists) and the corresponding maintainers.

Below, is a diagram that illustrates this whole process from the conception of the
patch, until its incorporation into the Linux kernel. This diagram, roughly, summarizes
the life of a patch. The original diagram in Brazillian Portuguese was done by
[Rubens Gomes Neto](https://github.com/kwy95) for his
[capstone project](https://linux.ime.usp.br/~rubensn/mac0499/monografia/monografia_entrega.pdf).

![Patch Life Cycle]({{site.url}}/images/diagrams/patch-lifecycle.png)

### **The Classic Approach**

As a maintainer, or just as someone who wants to help in reviewing, you would have
to [subscribe to the target list](http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html#subscription)
first to keep up with the patches (and discussions) sent to it.

Some problems may arise from this subscription approach, like having to keep a list
of all subscribed emails sending individual copies to each one, and requiring
the interested parties to be subscribed at all times, or else, some messages may be
lost (this can occur even if the interested party is subscribed, though).

### **An On-Demand Approach**

With the advent of the [`public-inbox`](https://public-inbox.org/README.html) technology,
which describes itself as *an "archives first" approach to mailing lists*, archives
of public mailing lists related to Linux kernel were created and hosted in
<https://lore.kernel.org> (for more information click [here](https://www.kernel.org/lore.html)).

This alternate and complementary approach to consuming mailing lists relegates the
need for subscriptions and all problems mentioned previously, and allows interested
parties to adopt an "on-demand" approach to keep up-to-date. Besides this major benefit,
some others can be listed, like allowing interested parties to consume lists using
NNTP, Atom feeds, or HTML archives, and is easy to deploy and manage, facilitating
mirroring.

## **Lore API**

---

> The API explained in this section is the result of much testing and experimenting
with the lore archives. As there is no official documentation on it, some information
may be imprecise.
{: .prompt-info }

For `kw patch-hub`, two types of data are requested to the lore
archives:

1. Public mailing lists archived.
2. Messages sent to an archived mailing list.

In this sense, requisitions for both types of data are responded to with a list of the
type of data. For example, by accessing <https://lore.kernel.org> in your browser,
the server responds with an HTML file with a list of the mailing lists archived.
If you access <https://lore.kernel.org/amd-gfx> a list of the latest messages sent
to the `amd-gfx` mailing list is received through an HTML file.

### **Query Strings**

As with some other web applications, lore accepts the use of queries when requesting
data to get a more fine-grained result. These queries are added to a base URL
using [Query Strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string). In this string,
a query parameter is separated from its value by `=` (equal) and pairs of query
parameters and values are separated by `&` (ampersand). To give an example, a query
string that assigns `cat` to `animal` and `yellow` to `color` for the base URL
`https://url.com/resource` would be:

```
https://url.com/resource?animal=cat&color=yellow
```

##### Query Parameter `o`

In the lore API, an important query parameter is the `o` parameter. Most lore
responses are paginated as a means to not overflow the server with requests with
massive responses, say, one that the full response would be the whole history of
messages sent to a mailing list. Pages have 200 entries at maximum.

To illustrate, the screenshot below is the bottom of <https://lore.kernel.org>,
which is a listing of the archived mailing lists, as said previously.

![Archived MLs bottom]({{site.url}}/images/lore_archived_mls_bottom.png)

Notice the information `Results 1-200 of ~244`. It means that there are more than
200 mailing lists archived in lore and this HTML contains only the first 200.
By clicking on the button `next (older)` we are redirected to <https://lore.kernel.org/?o=200>
that contains the remaining lists. The `o=200` indicates that we want the archived
mailing lists from the number 201 onwards. The screenshot below is the HTML response.

![Archived MLs older 200]({{site.url}}/images/lore_archived_mls_older_200.png)

This pagination mechanic also happens when requesting messages sent to a mailing
list.

##### Query Parameter `q`

Another important parameter, that only applies for querying messages sent to a
mailing list is the `q` parameter. This parameter is complex and represents
a search for messages that fulfill some criteria. Lore has search functionality
provided by [Xapian](https://xapian.org/) that supports typical operators AND, OR,
\+ and - present in other search engines like google.com, and filters for matches
on specific fields of the message. Supported filters can be seen at
<https://lore.kernel.org/amd-gfx/_/text/help> (this is the help page related to
the `amd-gfx` list, but all lists support the same set of filters).

As an example, if we want to match messages sent to the `git` mailing list that
contain *rebase* in the subject, the URL would be

<https://lore.kernel.org/git/?q=s:rebase>

In this same example, if we wanted to match messages that contain *rebase* in the
subject, were sent from *Linus Torvalds* and don't contain *bug* in the message
body, the URL would be

<https://lore.kernel.org/git/?q=s:rebase+AND+f:Linus%20Torvalds+AND+NOT+b:bug>

##### Query Parameter `x`

The last parameter that I will mention is the `x` parameter, which only applies to
querying messages and in conjunction with the `q` parameter. The only use that I
found for it is by setting its value to `A`, which makes the response of the request
to be an [Atom feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)). In essence,
this Atom feed is an XML file that follows the [Atom Syndication Format](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt)
and has the same entries as an equivalent request that produces an HTML file, but
with different attributes for each entry.

Expanding further upon the last example, to get its Atom feed, we access the URL

<https://lore.kernel.org/git/?q=s:rebase+AND+f:Linus%20Torvalds+AND+NOT+b:bug&x=A>

The first screenshot below refers to the HTML file returned, while the second refers
to the formatted Atom feed returned for the URL above.

![HTML git Linus query]({{site.url}}/images/html_git_linus_query.png)
![Atom feed git Linus query]({{site.url}}/images/atom_feed_git_linus_query.png)

### **Message-ID**

Each message archived in lore has a unique identifier named **Message-ID** (the
concept is discussed further [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message-ID)).
An URL with the lore domain, an archived mailing list, and a Message-ID, uniquely
identifies a message in lore. 

As an example, the URL

<https://lore.kernel.org/git/alpine.LFD.0.999.0708181547400.30176@woody.linux-foundation.org/>

uniquely identifies the message sent by Linus Torvalds on August 18 2007 at
15:52:55 -0700 with the subject `Take binary diffs into account for "git rebase"`
to the git mailing list.

## **How `kw patch-hub` uses the lore API**

---

As stated earlier, `kw patch-hub` has two tasks when it comes to consuming the
lore API directly: fetching the archived public mailing lists and fetching patches
(not any message) metadata from a given list.

### **Fetching Archived Public Mailing Lists**

To fetch the archived lists in lore, we simply request the base lore URL
<https://lore.kernel.org>, which returns us the first 200 mailing lists. Ideally,
we would also need to fetch all the next pages (mailing lists from 201 onwards)
to get all available mailing lists. This change is already cataloged and is 
due to be tackled soon.

> It is worth noting that the "order" of lists returned from lore seems to be related
to how active the lists are, but this isn't confirmed.
{: .prompt-warning }

### **Fetching Patches Metadata from a Mailing List**

At the moment, every fetch of patch metadata has the same base structure:

```
https://lore.kernel.org/<target-mailing-list/?o=<min-index>&x=A&q=rt:..AND+NOT+s:Re:
```

`<target-mailing-list>` is the list to query for patches.

The `o=<min-index>` part of the query string defines the minimum (exclusive) index
of the patch on the response.

The `x=A` part of the query string is to obtain an Atom feed because it contains
metadata of the author name, author email, Message-ID, and, as the file is an XML,
we can use a tool like `xpath` to easily parse it for these desired fields.

The `q=rt:..AND+NOT+s:Re:` part of the query string is composed of two filters:

1. `NOT+s:Re:`: The `s` prefix denotes the 'subject' of the message and the `Re:`
means the literal string 'Re:'. So, this filter translates to "match all messages
that **don't** have the literal 'Re:' in its subject". This filter is really important
since we are only looking for patches and they aren't replies (i.e., don't have
the literal 'Re:' in its subject).
2. `rt:..`: The `rt` prefix denotes the 'received time' of the message in lore servers,
and the `..` means a period with both ends open, or, in other words, this
filter can be translated to "match all messages that have **any** received time".
This filter is redundant, and the reason we used it is because lore API doesn't
seems to accept only `q=NOT+s:Re:`, so we apply a filter that in reality doesn't
filter anything.

In simple terms, the strategy to fetch patch metadata from lore is to manipulate
the `o=<min-index>` value to obtain adjacent chunks of patches. In reality, we
start with `o=0` and add 200 for each consequent fetch. This allows `kw patch-hub`
to fetch data at the user's desire (fetching more pages as he/she traverses through
the list history), while also respecting the 200 messages per response limitation
of the lore API.

Additional filters are appended to the end of this base structure, so, for instance,
if we want to request the third page of patches from the `bpf` list that have
the term 'packet' in its body, we use the URL

<https://lore.kernel.org/bpf/?o=400&x=A&q=rt:..+AND+NOT+s:Re:+AND+b:packet>

> To better view the example above in the browser, remove `&x=A` from the URL.

## **Conclusion**

---

The `kw patch-hub` feature has some critical points in its implementation that rely
on directly consuming the lore.kernel.org API. Differently from other APIs, this one
isn't well documented and much of the learnings expressed in this post were the
outcome of much experimentation, trial and error, and interpretation of what is
documented.

There are probably some other obscure intricacies of the lore API left to be discovered
that may help in improving `kw patch-hub`, but, in any case, the results achieved
at the moment validate the feasibility of the feature.
