In the final moments of the MiniDebconf in Belo Horizonte that I attended back
in April, as I was heading to the airport to go back home, a notification
popped up on my phone: I had been accepted into Google Summer of Code 2024. It
was a surreal and incredibly exciting moment.

# Google Summer of Code

Google Summer of Code provides a unique opportunity for participants to dive
into open-source projects, gaining hands-on experience and contributing to
global software development communities. Moreover, participants have the chance
to enhance their technical skills, build professional networks, and often
receive recognition and awards for their outstanding work throughout the
program.

# Why kworkflow?

Nowadays, the Linux kernel is a ubiquitous and critical piece of software for
the modern world, as it has been for years. Kernel development has a giant
impact on the technology industry as a whole. The kw project aims to provide
tools for everyday tasks and be a unified environment for kernel developers.

Developing for the kernel is a complex task and can often be very
time-consuming. Any help that can speed up this process is valuable. In this
sense, kworkflow stands out for facilitating the workflow of kernel developers.
I discovered the project through Rodrigo Siqueira, the primary maintainer of
the project, who introduced it to me. Since then, I have enjoyed a remarkably
enriching experience while contributing to the project, expanding my knowledge
in areas such as the use of Linux, Linux kernel development, Bash script, and
advanced Git.

# My proposal

Currently, kworkflow has unit tests to validate functionalities, in addition to
some basic integration tests, but the latter are not as robust as the
maintainers desire. My proposal for this GSoC is to develop a robust
infrastructure and implement integration tests that cover the deploy process.
Furthermore, I plan to expand the coverage of integration tests, encompassing
more system functionalities and flows, and improving the existing testing
infrastructure. Additionally, an idea exists for implementing an acceptance
testing pipeline that replicates a user's workflow, leveraging the full suite
of kworkflow features.

# Conclusion

I believe this will be a valuable opportunity for both my personal growth and
my career. I'm really excited about it! :-)
